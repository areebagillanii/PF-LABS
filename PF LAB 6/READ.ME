Basic Tasks – if-elseif-else 
◼ Write a program that takes an integer number as an input from user 
and checks if it positive , negative or zero.
◼ Write a program that suggests actions based on the temperature 
entered by the user. The program will take the temperature as input 
and provide advice for the user based on the range the temperature 
falls into. The suggestions will be:
❑ If the temperature is 40°C or higher, the program should advise the user to stay 
indoors because it is extremely hot and could be dangerous to health.
❑ If the temperature is between 30°C and 39°C, the program should suggest 
drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated in the hot weather.
❑ If the temperature is between 20°C and 29°C, the program should inform the user 
that the weather is pleasant and suitable for outdoor activities.
❑ If the temperature is below 20°C, the program should recommend wearing warm 
clothes to stay comfortable in the cooler weather.
Basic Tasks – if-elseif-else 
◼ Write a program to simulate a simple login system. The program will 
prompt the user to enter a username and password. It will then 
compare the input values with pre-defined, correct credentials to 
determine the appropriate response.
Predefined Correct Credentials:
❑ Username (string): admin 
❑ Password (string): 12345
The program will provide feedback based on the following scenarios:
❑ Both username and password are correct: The program will display "Access 
Granted.“
❑ Username is correct but the password is incorrect: The program will display 
"Wrong Password.“
❑ Username is incorrect (regardless of the password): The program will display 
"User Not Found."
University Exam Results and Scholarship Eligibility System
◼ You are tasked with creating a program for a university to analyze and classify 
students' results based on their performance in three subjects. The program must 
calculate the total marks, percentage, grade, and eligibility for a scholarship based on 
specific conditions.
Conditions:
Grade Calculation:
❑
❑
❑
❑
❑
Percentage >= 90: Grade A
Percentage >= 80 and < 90: Grade B
Percentage >= 70 and < 80: Grade C
Percentage >= 60 and < 70: Grade D
Percentage < 60: Grade F
Failure Condition:
❑
A student is considered failed if:
They score Grade F in any subject.
Scholarship Eligibility:
A student is eligible for a merit scholarship if:
❑
❑
They score Grade A in all three subjects.
The total marks are >= 270.
A student is eligible for a regular scholarship if:
❑
❑
They score at least Grade B in all three subjects.
The total marks are >= 240.
Output Details: 
❑
❑
❑
Display the total marks and percentage.
Show the grade for each subject.
Indicate if the student is eligible for a scholarship 
(and which type).
❑ If the student has failed, display "Failed" and 
terminate further calculations
Loan Eligibility Checker  --- Nested if
You work as a software developer for a bank. The bank needs a program that checks whether a person 
qualifies for a loan based on two criteria: age and income. 
The bank’s policies for loan eligibility are as follows:
Age Requirement: The person must be at least 18 years old to be considered for a loan. If they are 
younger than 18, the program should display a message:
"You are not eligible for a loan because you are under 18 years of age.“
Income Requirement: The person must have an annual income of at least $30,000.If they meet the age 
requirement but their income is less than $30,000, the program should display a message:
"You meet the age requirement but are not eligible for a loan because your income is below $30,000.“
Eligible Applicants: If the person meets both criteria, the program should congratulate them and 
display:
"Congratulations! You are eligible for a loan.“
Your task is to write a program that takes the age and income of a person as input and checks their 
eligibility based on the above rules. The program should give clear and descriptive messages for all 
possible cases.
Role Based Access System
◼ You are developing an Access Control System for a software platform. The system will first 
authenticate the user based on a predefined username and password. After successful 
authentication, the system will check the user's role to determine the level of access they should 
have. The roles can be either "Admin," "Guest," or any other custom role. The access permissions 
are as follows:
Authentication:
The system will compare the entered username and password with the predefined credentials. 
❑ If the username is "admin" and the password is "password123" the authentication is successful. 
The system will display:
"Authentication Successful!“
❑ If the username or password does not match the predefined values, the authentication will fail. 
The system will display:
"Authentication Failed. Access Denied.“
Role-Based Access: 
❑ If the role is "Admin":  The system will display: "Full Access“
❑ If the role is "Guest":   The system will display: "Limited Access“
❑ For any other role (e.g., "User," "Manager"): The system will display: "No Access"
