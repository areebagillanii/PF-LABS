TASK 1 – CALCULATING DISTANCE
▪ Write a C++ program to calculate the squared distance 
between two points in a 2D plane using initialized 
values for coordinates. 
This exercise reinforces variable declaration and       
initialization in C++.
Instructions
:
▪ Initialize the coordinates 𝑥1,𝑦1 and 𝑥2,𝑦2​ directly in 
the code as double variables.
▪ Use the formula:
squared_distance=(𝑥2−𝑥1)2+(𝑦2−𝑦1)2
Display the squared distance in the specified format.

TASK 2 : TOTAL PURCHASE CALCULATION
▪ A customer is buying five items in a store. The prices of these items 
are as follows:
▪ Item 1: $12.95
▪ Item 2: $24.95
▪ Item 3: $6.95
▪ Item 4: $14.95
▪ Item 5: $3.95
Write a C++ program that stores the prices of these five items in 
separate variables. Your program should:
▪ Display the price of each item individually.
▪ Calculate and display the subtotal of the sale (sum of all 
items).
▪ Calculate and display the sales tax (6% of the subtotal).
▪ Display the total amount (subtotal plus sales tax).
Note
: Use constants where appropriate (e.g., for the sales tax rate). 
Use appropriate datatypes to store result and values in variables & 
constants. This exercise focuses on understanding variables 
,constants and datatypes.

TASK 3 : Average of Predefined Test Scores Rounded to Two 
Decimal Places
▪ Write a C++ program that calculates the average of three predefined 
test scores and displays the result rounded to two decimal places. 
The program should have the test scores initialized in the code and, 
after calculating the average, format the output to show exactly two 
decimal places for clarity.
