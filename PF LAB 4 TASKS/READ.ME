Task 1 : Determine Even or Odd Numbers
◼ Write a program that checks if an integer inputted by user is even or 
odd using the ternary operator.
◼ Format the output to display:
❑ "The number X is even" if the number is even. "The number X is odd"   if 
the number is odd.
Input Example:
❑ Enter an integer : 5
❑ Enter an integer : 12
Output Format Example:
❑ The number 5 is odd
❑ The number 12 is even
11

Task 2 :  Age Group Classification
◼ Write a program that classifies a person’s age into different 
categories:
❑ "Child" if the age is less than 13.
❑ "Teenager" if the age is between 13 and 19.
❑ "Adult" if the age is 20 or greater. 
Use the ternary operator to classify the age and display the output.
Input Example:
❑ 10
❑ 15
❑ 25
Output Format Example:
❑ Age 10 falls under the category: Child
❑ Age 15 falls under the category: Teenager
❑ Age 25 falls under the category: AduLT
Task 3 : Banking App
◼ Write a program that checks a customer's bank account balance and 
determines both their account type and special offer eligibility.
◼ The program should work as follows:
❑ Account Type Determination:
◼ If the account balance is less than $100, the account is considered a Low Balance 
account.
◼ If the account balance is between $100 and $500 (inclusive), it is considered a Standard 
Account.
◼ If the account balance is greater than $500, it is considered a Premium Account.
❑ Special Offer Eligibility:
◼ The customer is eligible for a special offer if their account balance is greater than $200 
and they are also a loyal customer. The loyalty status is provided as a Boolean value (1 
for loyal, 0 for not loyal).
❑ Output Format:
◼ Print the Account Type based on the account balance. 
◼ Print whether the customer is eligible for a special offer based on their balance and 
loyalty status.
You are required to use the ternary operator to implement all the decision-making logic in your 
program. You should not use if-else statements. Additionally, use logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) 
where needed to combine multiple conditions.
